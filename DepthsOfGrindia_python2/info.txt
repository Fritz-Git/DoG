This is the original build created in 3/20/2018. Was written in Python's IDLE IDE.

GOAL OF THE GAME
Your goal is to escape an unknown dungeon you have found yourself in. Build up your character, find items and weapons throughout a randomly generated map. As you level up, enemies will scale up with you as you proceed through your journey.
The game will end usually after 200 steps, give or take depending on the games randomly generated length.

FEATURES
This game includes a save and load feature, allowing you to continue where you left off, as well as a simple enemy scaling system based on your current level. The game also features dynamic item usage, where some items react differently depending on your situation.
